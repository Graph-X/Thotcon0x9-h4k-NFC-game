# Hak4Kidz Building Block Multiverse Game
## Created for the 2017 Hak4Kidz Milwaukee and Chicago. 

` This is the code for the game I wrote for Hak4Kidz and a talk about the game I gave at Thotcon0x9. It's written poorly in PHP and uses MySQL/MariaDB to store challenge and guide information.  Since I suck at real development, I used a free app called NFC tasks to facilitate the client side (phone) actions.  This can be better, but I just didn't have the time to make it so.  Feel free to do that for me.  I like PRs.`

` Please contribute to making my bad code better.  It's really hacked up so anything to make it better is welcome.  Submit pull requests as long as they don't break the code more.  I don't need help writing bad code.  I can do that pretty well on my own :D `
